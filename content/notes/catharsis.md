Sometimes I have thoughts and feelings that don't seem to materialize fully
until I put the proverbial pen to paper. I'm one to keep my feelings close.
Especially Grief, for some reason. I treat it like a child: I shelter it, keep
it close. I feed it. Tuck it in and sing it lullabies as it goes to sleep.

As much as I hate it, expressing grief is one of the best ways I've found to let
it spread its wings and fly the coop. My inner critic does not want to explore
personal pain publicly. It's a bizarre, attention-seeking thing to do. That's
what I tell myself, anyways. I have such a profound, unexplainable need to
express what I've experienced, though. Not in an effort to hurt anyone else's
reputation. Not as a cry for help, either. But in an effort to understand
myself. To have a grown-up discussion with Grief. Face-to-face. To put that
discussion where anyone can see it. And then to walk away.

* Truth: I am awkward sometimes, yes.
* Truth also: That's okay. I have friends who don't really see me as just that.
* Even more truth: The most important person to me said that I was awkward
after we loved each other for five years and before she left me.
* One lie: She is not at all awkward and the color and wonder that life had
before she left will never return.

See, that last one is especially important, Grief. I want you to write that
down. Don't roll your eyes either. I know that you don't really believe it
could be a lie. I've entertained your passion and tenacity about the issue and
kind of respectfully--but mostly just hopelessly--found ways to tip-toe around
telling you that you're wrong, but you really are. You're just wrong.

Wise words, thank you Liz. Kind of dramatic though, let's be honest. Who writes
poems about Grief? She must have been a brave poet, experiencing Grief without
ever feeling hopeless. Or maybe she was just a liar poet... Who knows? Life has a
way of making us eat our own words now and then and sooner or later. I hope she
never did. It's more romantic that way.

## Hopeless (passionless, or so I'm told) Grief

## Hopeful (and therefore passionate!) Grief

Darling, I wish you well. Even though you're awkward, just like the rest of us.
