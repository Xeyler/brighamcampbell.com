Since my first time playing that Gameboy, I've learned a lot more about how they
work. Along the way, I got kind of involved with the Gameboy homebrew community
(which is still surprisingly active, despite the Gameboy's age). An interesting
discussion that I heard now and then was whether C was low-level enough to be
useful for Gameboy development. Gameboy developers sat in one of two camps: C or
assembly.

I was a little more deviant. When I wrote a simple "hello world" program for the
Gameboy, I opted to program it directly in machine code with a hex editor.
