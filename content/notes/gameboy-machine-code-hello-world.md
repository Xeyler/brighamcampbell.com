I grew up in the early 2000s. It was a different time: corduroy overalls,
drinking from garden hoses, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, AA batteries, Spongebob on
Saturdays, and playing in the dirt. When I think back to that time, I remember a
specific visit to Grandma's house. I had found an old, beige Gameboy in a box of
Aunt Em's old stuff.

Apparently, the only game Em had was The Lion King. As far as Gameboy games go,
The Lion King actually had some pretty baller graphics. Not that I would know,
of course... I spent that entire afternoon trying to get past one level.

Since my first time playing that Gameboy, I've learned a lot more about how they
work and I became kind of infamous among 

## It's all bytes



## Opcodes

## Speaking Gameboy's language

## Putting it all together
